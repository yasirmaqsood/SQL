## LEFT JOIN
  ### Find the list of all buildings that have employees 
  SELECT DISTINCT Building_name from Buildings LEFT JOIN Employees on Buildings.Building_name=Employees.Building where Employees.Building NOT NULL;
  
## IS NULL / NOT NULL
  ### Find the names of the buildings that hold no employees

## Aggregate Functions
  | Function     | Description |
| ---      | ---       |
| COUNT(column) | counts the number of rows in the group if no column name is specified. Otherwise, count the number of rows in the group with non-NULL values in the specified column.         |
| MIN(column)     |	Finds the smallest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.|        |
| MAX(column) | Finds the largest numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.         |
| AVG(column)     | Finds the average numerical value in the specified column for all rows in the group.|        |
| SUM(column) |Finds the sum of all numerical values in the specified column for the rows in the group.        |
  
  #### NOTE: Group By means that all rows having common Column value (Use only those rows to perform any function)
  
  ## Having By
  
    As group by is used after where clause, there needs to be any "Where Type" clause applied on grouped rows. 
    For this purpuse Having is used
  
  ## Order of Query
    SELECT DISTINCT column, AGG_FUNC(column_or_expression), â€¦

    JOIN another_table ON mytable.column = another_table.column
    WHERE constraint_expression
    GROUP BY column
    HAVING constraint_expression
    ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
    LIMIT count OFFSET COUNT;
    
  ### Find the total domestic and international sales that can be attributed to each director
